## Movie Recommender System | Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendation
This project implements a Machine Learning-based Movie Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The system consists of two main components:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training (movie_recommindation.ipynb) ‚Üí Prepares the dataset, trains the recommendation model, and saves processed data.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Web Application (app.py) ‚Üí Loads the trained model and provides an interactive interface for users to get movie recommendations.

1. # **Project Overview**
This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences. It applies collaborative filtering, where recommendations are made based on user ratings.

‚ú® ## **Features**
‚úî Uses KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) for collaborative filtering.
‚úî Suggests movies similar to a given movie.
‚úî Fetches movie posters dynamically from TMDb & OMDb APIs.
‚úî Provides an interactive UI using Streamlit.
‚úî Processes the MovieLens dataset for recommendations.

2. # **Code Breakdown**
üìå movie_recommindation.py ‚Äì Model Training & Preprocessing

This script prepares data, trains the recommendation model, and saves processed data for later use.

üõ† ## **Steps in model_training.py**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load the MovieLens dataset

Reads movies.csv (movie titles) and ratings.csv (user ratings).

Displays dataset information using .info() and .head().

2Ô∏è‚É£ Filter Active Users

Keeps only users who have rated more than 200 movies for better recommendations.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Merge Ratings with Movie Titles

Joins ratings with movies to link movieId to actual movie titles.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Filter Movies with Enough Ratings

Keeps only movies with at least 5000 ratings to ensure quality recommendations.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Pivot Table

Converts the dataset into a user-movie matrix, where:

Rows = Movie titles

Columns = Users

Values = Ratings (0 for missing ratings)

6Ô∏è‚É£ Train the KNN Recommendation Model

Converts the pivot table into a sparse matrix for efficient computation.

Trains a Nearest Neighbors model using the Brute Force algorithm.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Test Movie Recommendations

Finds similar movies for "Spider-Man (2002)" and "Batman Begins (2005)".

Prints the top 6 closest movies based on similarity.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Save Model & Processed Data

Stores the trained model and processed data using pickle.

üìå app.py ‚Äì Streamlit Web Application

This script loads the trained model and provides an interactive interface where users can select a movie and receive recommendations.

üõ† ## **Steps in app.py**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Load Required Libraries

Imports pickle (for loading the model), numpy, requests, and streamlit.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Load Pre-Trained Model & Processed Data

Loads:

model.pkl ‚Üí Trained KNN model

movies_pivot.pkl ‚Üí Movie-user pivot table

final_rating.pkl ‚Üí Processed movie rating dataset

movie_names.pkl ‚Üí List of available movie titles

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up API Keys

Uses TMDb API and OMDb API to fetch movie posters.

Defines a default placeholder image for missing posters.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Functions to Fetch Movie Posters

fetch_movie_poster_tmdb() ‚Üí Gets movie posters from TMDb.

fetch_movie_poster_omdb() ‚Üí Falls back to OMDb if TMDb fails.

fetch_movie_poster() ‚Üí Tries TMDb first, then OMDb, otherwise uses a default image.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch Movie Genres

fetch_genre(suggestion) ‚Üí Retrieves genres for recommended movies.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Movie Recommendation Function

recommend_movies(movie_name, number_of_movies)

Finds similar movies using the trained KNN model.

Fetches movie genres for the recommendations.

Returns a list of recommended movie titles & genres.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Streamlit Web App

Movie Selection Dropdown (st.selectbox) ‚Üí Allows users to select a movie.

Number of Recommendations Dropdown (st.selectbox) ‚Üí Lets users choose how many movies to get.

"Show Recommendation" Button (st.button) ‚Üí Displays recommendations, including:

Movie titles
Movie genres
Movie posters
